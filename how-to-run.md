#How to run the file ?

1. Clone the repo/download/whatever.
2. Install the requirements with "pip3 install -r requirements.txt"
3. Most completed functions are stored inside /functions. They can be imported to the jupyter notebook in root & used there (newer stuff can be developed there for quicker experimentation).
