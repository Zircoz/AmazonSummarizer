# AmazonSummarizer

This tool is supposed to do exactly what the name says, "summarizing your Amazon data". Doesn't matter if you want to see your amazon spending for better planning in the future, or if you are a curious soul trying to ðŸ˜² from your "Amazon behavior", this tool is for YOU.

## OK, but how do I load my Amazon data?

Amazon collects and stores a plethora of data for your (& and their ;)) benefit. You can request a copy from them [HERE](https://www.amazon.in/gp/privacycentral/dsar/preview.html). For now, this tool would only use order history (expanding soon*).

NOTE: NEVER commit your Amazon data files to the repo. It contains sensitive information that you wouldn't want to put out there for everyone to see.

*soon = as soon as I get the data I've requested and can find time to understand the relation between those files. ðŸ˜‚
